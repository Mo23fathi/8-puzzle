8-Puzzle Game using AI Algorithms
This Java project implements an 8-Puzzle game solver using various AI algorithms. The 8-Puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle game where the goal is to arrange the tiles in numerical order by sliding them into the empty space.

Overview
The project provides implementations of several AI algorithms to solve the 8-Puzzle game efficiently:

A Algorithm (8-puzzle-using-AI_Astar)**: Uses the A search algorithm with various heuristics to find the optimal solution to the puzzle.
Breadth-First Search (8-puzzle-using-AI_BFS): Implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm to explore all possible moves and find a solution.
Depth-First Search (8-puzzle-using-AI_DFS): Implements the Depth-First Search algorithm to explore the search space deeply and find a solution.
Heuristic Functions (8-puzzle-using-AI_Heuristics): Provides various heuristic functions for use with the A* algorithm, including Manhattan distance and misplaced tiles.
Main Class (8-puzzle-using-AI_Main): Main class to run the 8-Puzzle solver and test different algorithms.
Puzzle Class (8-puzzle-using-AI_puzzle): Represents the 8-Puzzle game board and provides methods for generating random puzzles, checking if a puzzle is solvable, and performing moves.
